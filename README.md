## Introduction

The Q-man Experience Classifier project is designed to analyze and classify users based on their interaction with keyboards and mice. By incorporating LEDs and Machine Learning techniques, we aim to quantify the user experience and gain insights into how users interact with input devices.

## Features

- LED-based data collection for user interaction patterns.
- Machine Learning models for classification and experience measurement.
- User-friendly interface to visualize and interpret the results.
- Modular and extensible design for easy integration of new features.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Q-man Experience Classifier project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Q-man-Experience-Classifier.git
cd Q-man-Experience-Classifier
```

2. **Set Up the Environment:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Collect Data:**
Connect the LED module and gather data on user interactions.

4. **Train the Model:**
Train the Machine Learning model using the provided data.

## Usage

1. **Data Collection:**
- Connect the LED module to the user's input devices (keyboard, mouse).
- Gather data on the user's interaction patterns.

2. **Model Training:**
- Preprocess the collected data.
- Train the Machine Learning model using the provided scripts.

3. **Classification:**
- Use the trained model to classify users based on their interaction patterns.
